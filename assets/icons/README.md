# Icons

Please place the following icon files in this directory:

- `tray_icon_macos.png` - Default system tray icon for macOS (16x16 or 32x32 pixels)
- `tray_icon_active_macos.png` - Active state system tray icon for macOS
- `tray_icon.png` - Default system tray icon for other platforms
- `tray_icon_active.png` - Active state system tray icon for other platforms

For now, the app will use default icons if these files are not present.
